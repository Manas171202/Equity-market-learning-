              <h4>Fundamental Analysis</h4>
              <p>
                Fundamental Analysis (FA) is a holistic approach to study a business. When an investor wishes to invest in a business for the long term (say 3 – 5 years), it becomes essential to understand the business from various perspectives. It is critical for an investor to separate the daily short term noise in the stock prices and concentrate on the underlying business performance.
                 Over the long term, a fundamentally strong company’s stock prices tend to appreciate, thereby creating wealth for its investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have many such examples in the Indian market. To name a few, one can think of companies such as Infosys Limited, TCS Limited, Page Industries, Eicher Motors, Bosch India, Nestle India, TTK Prestige etc. Each of these companies has delivered an average over 20% compounded annual growth return (CAGR) year on year for over 10 years. At a 20% CAGR, the investor would double his money in roughly about 3.5 years to give you a perspective. Higher the CAGR faster is the wealth creation process. Some companies such as Bosch India Limited have delivered close to 30% CAGR. Therefore,
                 you can imagine the magnitude and the speed at which wealth is created if one would invest in fundamentally strong companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technical Analysis (TA) helps you garner quick short term returns. It helps you time the market for a better entry and exit. However, TA is not an effective approach to create wealth.
                 Wealth is created only by making intelligent long term investments. However, both TA & FA must coexist in your market strategy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fundamental Analysis is used to make long term investments.
Investment in a company with good fundamentals creates wealth.
Using Fundamental Analysis, one can separate an investment-grade company from a junk company.
              </p>

       <p>   All investment-grade companies exhibit a few common traits. Likewise, all junk companies exhibit common traits.
Fundamental analysis helps the analysts identify these traits.
Both Technical analysis and fundamental analysis should coexist as a part of your market strategy.
To become a fundamental analyst, one does not require any special skill. Common sense, basic mathematics, and a bit of business sense are all that is required.
A core-satellite approach to capital allocation is a prudent market strategy.
The tools required for FA are generally fundamental; most of these tools are available for free.
              </p>

              <h4>Tools for FA </h4>
              <p>
                The tools required for fundamental analysis are fundamental,
                 most of which are available for free. Specifically, you would need the following:
              </p>
              <P>
                <h6> Company’s annual report</h6> – All the information you need for FA is available in the annual report.
                 You can download the annual report from the company’s website for free
              </P>
              <p>
               <h6>Industry-related data</h6> – You will need industry data to see how the company under consideration is performing concerning the industry. 
                Basic data is available for free and is usually published in the industry’s association website
              </p>
              <p>
              <h6>Access to the news</h6> – Daily News helps you stay updated on the latest developments in the industry and the company you are interested in.
                 A good business newspaper or services such as Google Alert can help you stay abreast of the latest news
              </p>
              <P>
               <H6>MS Excel</H6> – Although not free, MS Excel can be extremely helpful in fundamental calculations
              </P>
              <p>
                With just these four tools, one can develop a fundamental analysis that can rival institutional research. 
                You can believe me when I say that you don’t need any other tool to do good fundamental research. In fact,
                 even at the institutional level, the objective is to keep the research simple and logical.
              </p>

            <div id="item-1-2">
              <h4>What is Annual Report</h4>
              <p>
                The annual report (AR) is a yearly publication by the company and is sent to the shareholders and other interested parties. The annual report is published by the end of the Financial Year,
                 and all the data made available in the annual report is dated to 31st March. The AR is usually available on the company’s website (in the investor’s section) as a PDF document, or one can contact the company to get a hard copy of the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the company’s annual report, whatever is mentioned in the AR is assumed to be official. 
                Hence, any misrepresentation of facts in the annual report can be held against the company. To give you a perspective, AR contains the auditor’s certificates (signed, dated, and sealed) certifying the sanctity of the financial data included in the annual report.
              </p>
              <p>
                Potential investors and the present shareholders are the primary audiences for the annual report.
                  Annual reports should provide the most pertinent information to an investor and communicate its primary message.
                   For an investor, the annual report must be the default option to seek information about a company. Of course, 
                   many media websites claim to give financial information about the company; however, 
                   the investors should avoid seeking information from such sources.
                    Remember the information is more reliable if we get it to get it directly from the annual report.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="item-2">
              <h4>Financial statement ( P/L statement )</h4>
              <p>
                The financial statement provides information and conveys the financial position of the company.
A complete set of financial statements include the Profit & Loss Account, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.
A fundamental Analyst is a financial statement user, and he needs to know what the maker of the financial statements states.
              </p>

         <p>     The profit and loss statement gives the profitability of the company for the year under consideration.
The P&L statement is an estimate, as the company can revise the numbers at a later point. Also, by default, companies publish data for the current year and the previous year, side by side.
The revenue side of the P&L is also called the top line of the company.
Revenue from operations is the main source of revenue for the company.
Other operating income includes revenue incidental to the business.
The other income includes revenue from non-operating sources.
The sum of revenue from (operations less of duty) and other operating income gives the “net revenue from operations”.

            </div>
            <div id="item-3">
              <h4>About P/L </h4>
              <p>
                A profit and loss statement, also known as an income statement, is a financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred by a business during a specific period of time, usually a month, quarter, or year.
                 The purpose of the statement is to show the business's profitability over the period covered by the statement.
              </p>
              <p>
                The statement begins with the company's total revenue, which includes all the money earned during the period from sales, services rendered, and other income sources. Next, the statement subtracts the cost of goods sold (COGS), which represents the direct costs associated with producing or delivering the goods or services sold during the period.
                 COGS includes the cost of materials, labor, and overhead associated with the production or delivery of the goods or services.
              </p>
              <p>
                After subtracting COGS from total revenue, the statement shows the business's gross profit, which represents the profit earned from sales after accounting for direct costs.
                 The statement then deducts operating expenses, such as rent, utilities, salaries, and advertising, from gross profit to arrive at the business's operating profit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the statement takes into account any interest income or expenses, taxes paid, and other non-operating income or expenses to arrive at the business's net profit or loss.
                 If the net result is a positive number, the business has made a profit, while a negative number indicates a loss.
              </p>
              <p>
                A profit and loss statement is an essential tool for business owners and investors to understand the financial health of a company.
                 It helps them assess the profitability of the business and make informed decisions about its future operations. As with any financial statement, it is important to ensure that a profit and loss statement is accurate, up-to-date, and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to avoid potential legal and financial consequences.

              <h5>What is balance sheet </h5>
              <p>
                A balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It is divided into two main sections: assets and liabilities.

Assets are resources that a company owns or controls and are expected to provide future economic benefits. Liabilities are obligations that a company owes to others and are expected to require future economic resources to settle. The difference between assets and liabilities is called equity or owner's equity, which represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities.

The asset section of the balance sheet is divided into two categories: current assets and non-current assets. Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted to cash or used up within one year or the operating cycle of the company, whichever is longer. Examples of current assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses. Non-current assets, on the other hand, are assets that are expected to provide economic benefits for more than one year.
 Examples of non-current assets include property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and long-term investments.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="item-3-2">
              <h5>More about balance sheet</h5>
              <P>
                A Balance sheet also called the Statement of Financial Position is prepared on a flow basis that depicts the company’s financial position at any given point in time. It is a statement which shows what the company owns ( assets) and what the company owes (liabilities)
A business will generally need a balance sheet when it seeks investors, applies for loans, submits taxes etc.
Balance sheet equation is Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity.
              </P>
              <p>
                Liabilities are obligations or debts of a business from past transactions, and Share capital is the number of shares * face value.
Reserves are the funds earmarked for a specific purpose, which the company intends to use in future.
The surplus is where the profits of the company reside. This is one of the points where the balance sheet and the P&L interact. Dividends are paid out of the surplus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shareholders’ equity = Share capital + Reserves + Surplus. Equity is the claim of the owners on the assets of the company. It represents the assets that remain after deducting the liabilities if you rearrange the Balance Sheet equation, Equity = Assets – Liabilities.
Non-current liabilities or the long-term liabilities are expected to be settled in not less than 365 days or 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities arise due to the discrepancy in the way the depreciation is treated. Deferred tax liabilities are amounts of income taxes payable in the future concerning taxable differences as per accounting books and tax books.
              </p>
              <P>
                Current liabilities are the company’s obligations to settle within 365 days /12 months of the balance sheet date.
In most cases, both long and short term provisions are liabilities dealing with employee-related matters
Total Liability = Shareholders’ Funds + Non-Current Liabilities + Current Liabilities. . Thus, total liabilities represent the total amount of money the company owes to others

             Cash flow
                </h5>
                <p>
                  The Cash flow statement gives us a picture of the true cash position of the company.
A legitimate company has three main activities – operating activities, investing activities and the financing activities.
Each activity either generates or drains money for the company.</p>
<p>The company’s net cash flow is the sum of operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
Investors should specifically look at the cash flow from operating activities of the company.
When the liabilities increase, cash level increases and vice versa
When the assets increase, cash level decreases and vice versa.
The net cash flow number for the year is also reflected in the balance sheet.
The Statement of Cash flow is a useful addition to a company’s financial statements because it indicates the company’s performance.

                    ‘Limited Resource’ Equity Research can be performed in 3 stages.
                    Understanding the Business,
                    Application of the checklist,
                    Valuations.
                    The objective of stage 1, i.e. understanding the business requires us to gather all business information. The best way to go about this is the Q&A way
                    In the Q&A way, we begin with posting some simple and straightforward questions for which we find answers
                    By the time we finish stage 1, we should be through with all the information related to the business
                    Most of the answers required in stage 1 are present in the company’s annual report and website
                    Do you remember while researching the company in stage 1, if there is something not very convincing about the company, it is often a good idea to stop researching further
                    You need to get convinced (based on facts) about the company in stage 1. This is how you will develop a strong conviction to stay put during bear markets
                    Stage 2 of Equity Research requires you to evaluate the performance of the company on various counts.
                    You will proceed to stage 3 only after the company clears in stage 1 & 2.
