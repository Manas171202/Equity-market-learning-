        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Equity Market</h4>
        <p>Equity market is one of the great investments a person can make , taking about indian stock market it is handled by regulatory body 
            named SEBI ( Securities and Exchange board of India ). And NSE (National stock exchange) is one of the leading stock exchange in indian
            An individual can expect returns upto 15 % over a long period of time if he invest wisely in fundamentally good stocks . We will futhur study 
            how we find fundamnetally good stock .  NSE was the first exchange in India to implement electronic or screen-based trading. It began operations in 1994 and is ranked as the largest 
            stock exchange in India in terms of total and average daily turnover for equity shares every year since 1995, [based on SEBI data].

            To determine the market trend, the market experts cannot calculate the performance of each listed stock. That would be time-consuming and impossible as thousands of stocks are listed, and by the end of the calculation, the market trends would have changed.
So, how can anyone make a spontaneous decision? With an Index value.
An index picks a sample of listed companies from their respective industries that act as a representative. It is similar to choosing a few apples from the basket and not the entire store, as they would be enough to know if the Apples are overall good. This sample of listed companies is called the Index, and the companies under the sample are called index constituents.
In the Index, stocks are not picked only from a specific industry; instead, they are chosen from all the major sectors. This way, when the performance is evaluated and presented, we are looking at the overall picture and not a specific industry in the stock market.
        </p>
        <p>
            In India, there are two stock exchanges; the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange.
             Each stock exchange needs to have an index to measure the performance of the market. 
             Sensex is the Index for Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), and Nifty is the Index for National Stock Exchange (NSE).
        </p>
        <P>
            Sensex, aka Sensitive Index, is the Index for the Bombay Stock Exchange. As discussed earlier, an index is a sample of listed companies that act as the
             representative. Over 6000 companies are listed under the Bombay Stock Exchange, and practically it would be impossible to analyze the performance individually.
To solve this issue, BSE uses Sensex. Sensex picks up 30 companies that are luring, performing, and best for the market. If these companies are performing poorly,
 then the market trends are down. However, if only these 30 companies are outperforming, then the market trends are bullish.
        </P>
        <p>
            Nifty is the Index used by the National Stock Exchange and is made by the combination of National and Fifty (Nifty). Unlike Sensex, Nifty collects the sample of 50 performing and 
            luring stocks to determine the market trends.
Similar to Sensex, Nifty picks stocks from different sectors. 
Some of these include the stocks from the sectors such as IT, Consumer Goods, financial services, automobiles, telecommunication,
 and more. Besides, stocks picked under Nifty are those that outperform others.

        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Mutual funds</h4>
        <p>
            A mutual fund is a pool of money managed by a professional Fund Manager.

It is a trust that collects money from a number of investors who share a common investment objective and invests the same in equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities. And the income / gains generated from this collective investment is distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting applicable expenses and levies, by calculating 
a scheme’s “Net Asset Value” or NAV. Simply put, the money pooled in by a large number of investors is what makes up a Mutual Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here’s a simple way to understand the concept of a Mutual Fund Unit.
Let’s say that there is a box of 12 chocolates costing ₹40. Four friends decide to buy the same, but they have only ₹10 each and the shopkeeper only sells by the box. So the friends then decide to pool in ₹10 each and buy the box of 12 chocolates. Now based on their contribution, they each receive 3 chocolates or 3 units, if equated with Mutual Funds.
And how do you calculate the cost of one unit? Simply divide the total amount with the total number of chocolates: 40/12 = 3.33.
So if you were to multiply the number of units (3) with the cost per unit (3.33), you get the initial investment of ₹10.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, let us understand what is “Net Asset Value” or NAV. Just like an equity share has a traded price, a mutual fund unit has Net Asset Value per Unit. The NAV is the combined market value of the shares, bonds and securities held by a fund on any particular day (as reduced by permitted expenses and charges). NAV per Unit represents the market value of all the Units in 
            a mutual fund scheme on a given day, net of all expenses and liabilities plus income accrued, 
            divided by the outstanding number of Units in the scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mutual funds are ideal for investors who either lack large sums for investment, or for those who neither have the inclination nor the time to research the market, yet want to grow their wealth. The money collected in mutual funds is invested by professional fund managers in line with the scheme’s stated objective. In return, the fund house charges a small fee which is deducted from the investment. The fees 
            charged by mutual funds are regulated and are subject to certain limits specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Coorporate Bonds</h4>
        <p>
            A bond is a debt obligation, like an Iou. Investors who
buy corporate bonds are lending money to the company
issuing the bond. In return, the company makes a legal
commitment to pay interest on the principal and, in
most cases, to return the principal when the bond comes
due, or matures. 
        </p>
        <p>
            to understand bonds, it is helpful to compare them with
stocks. When you buy a share of common stock, you own
equity in the company and will receive any dividends
declared and paid by the company. When you buy a
corporate bond, you do not own equity in the company
